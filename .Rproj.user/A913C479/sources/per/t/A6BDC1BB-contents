"Heritability" in this context refers to dividing cells

# Historical Perspective

--

### Watson & Crick (1950's)

--

**Alexander Todd** (organic chemist) had determined that the backbone of the DNA molecule contained repeating phosphate and deoxyribose sugar groups. 

--

**Erwin Chargaff** (biochem) had found that while the amount of DNA and of its four types of bases--the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases cytosine (C) and thymine(T)--varied widely from species to species, A and T always appeared in ratios of one-to-one, as did G and C. 

--

**Maurice Wilkins** and **Rosalind Franklin** had obtained high-resolution X-ray images of DNA fibers that suggested a helical, corkscrew-like shape. 

--

**Linus Pauling** then the world's leading physical chemist, had recently discovered the single-stranded alpha helix, the structure found in many proteins, prompting biologists to think of helical forms.

# Western Blotting - Overview

<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/SDS-PAGE_Electrophoresis.png">
</center>

--

- SDS coats proteins in a uniform negative charge

--

- The positive electrode pulls the proteins through the gel matrix & proteins are separated based on their weights.

--

- A second step of electrophoresis involves pulling the proteins forward (out of the gel and onto a sticky piece of "membrane paper")

--

- "Poly-acrylamide-gel-electrophoresis" - aka PAGE

- Perform qPCR on output gDNA to investigated *which* stretches of DNA are associated with a specific target DNA-associated protein

---

# Experimental Applications for Molecular Endpoints

--

- "Measure" style experiment 

--

- "Block" style expeeriment 

--

- "Mimic" style experiment 

--

- Use in modern neuroscience: Validations for more complex tools. 

--

- Both RNA extraction and ChIP lend themselves well to "seq-style" investigations (next week)

---

# Key limitations to Molecular approaches

### Generally correlative in nature

- The "brain" endpoint and the "behaviour" endpoint aren't considered together using classic inferential statistics. 

- Expensive, time-consuming, labour-intensive
